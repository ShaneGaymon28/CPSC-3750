# Project 3 - Nginx and NodeJS

## Description
  In this project, we transitioned from apache2 and static files to a combination of nginx and nodejs. 
  We installed and configured nginx and nodejs, hosted a statuc file through nginx and configured nginx to send certain requests to nodejs which will return dynamic content.

## Requirements
  * index.html - file shown at http://yourIP/project3/

  * The URL http://yourip/project3/dynamic/ returns "hello world" and is a route defined in server.js file

  * The URL http://yourip/project3/dynamic/time returns the current date and time and is a route defined in server.js

  * Any other URL that starts with http://yourip/project3/dynamic/ besides what is mentioned above, returns "the path was <path>"
